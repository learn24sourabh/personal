Yes, it is possible to generate a single HTML report that consolidates results from all collections run using Newman. Newman itself does not support generating a single HTML report for multiple collections out of the box, but you can achieve this by combining the results from individual Newman runs into a single report manually or using a script.

Here's a basic approach using a script (assuming you have Node.js installed):

Run Newman for each collection:
You need to run Newman separately for each collection and save the JSON output.

bash
Copy code
newman run collection1.json -r json --reporter-json-export collection1_result.json
newman run collection2.json -r json --reporter-json-export collection2_result.json
# Add more commands for each collection
Replace collection1.json, collection2.json, etc., with your actual collection files.

Merge JSON result files:
After running Newman for each collection, merge the JSON result files into a single file. You can do this using a script or manually using a tool like jq (a lightweight and flexible command-line JSON processor).

Hereâ€™s an example using jq:

bash
Copy code
jq -s '[.[][]]' collection1_result.json collection2_result.json > merged_results.json
This command reads all JSON files (collection1_result.json, collection2_result.json, etc.), merges them into a single array, and writes the merged array into merged_results.json.

Generate HTML report:
Finally, generate an HTML report from the merged JSON file using Newman's built-in HTML reporter.

bash
Copy code
newman run merged_results.json -r html --reporter-html-export combined_report.html
This command will generate a single HTML report (combined_report.html) that includes results from all the collections.

Important Notes:
Ensure you have installed Newman (npm install -g newman) and jq (if you choose to use it).
Adjust paths and filenames according to your setup.
You may need to customize the HTML report template if you have specific formatting requirements beyond the default Newman HTML reporter.
This approach leverages Newman's ability to export results as JSON and generate HTML reports, combined with scripting for merging JSON files, to achieve a single consolidated report for multiple collections.
